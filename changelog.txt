WHATS NEW:

###
# Space is now safe from the rain cycle.
# Added previously missing non-safe furniture, including new "soft" tiles that are unsafe. A tooltip has been added to tiles that are not safe to use as shelter.
# Adjusted the NPC interaction with the rain cycle, now non-town NPCs will immediately disappear upon contact with death rain.
# Added a config to change when the rain cycle ends, midnight or morning. A reload is required for the change to take effect.
# Small changes to various texts, mostly grammar fixes.
